# Bill of Materials

## Plated, 1515 Extrusion, 6mm Belts

### Source:
- 2x cut aluminum plates, 0.125" / 3.2mm thick, using DXF/xyjplate[x2].dxf
- 1x cut titanium plate, 0.063" / 1.6mm thick, using DXF/1515_x_backer_(size).DXF
- 1515 profile extrusion, e.g. [from Misumi](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300465870/)
    - Length is the X-axis extrusion, e.g. 300mm spec Trident uses 380mm extrusion
- M3 tap to use on the extrusion ends

- 18x misumi1515nodropsquare.stl (You may have leftovers)

### Small Parts:
- 4x M3 heatset inserts
    - Insert into xyj-*-lower-plated printed parts
- 2x 6mm pulley for belts
- 8x F695 bearing (Four greater than the stock XY joints)
- 18x Roll/Slide-in M3 T-nuts for 1515 Extrusions
    - choose the correct type for your 1515 profile. LDO and Makerbeam are different.
- 20x M3x6mm BHCS
    - 2x through rear of extrusion
    - 10x through X-axis MGN rail (for 300mm spec / 350mm rail / 380mm extrusion)
    - 8x through plates into Y axis MGN carriage
- 4x M3x8mm SHCS
    - 4x through upper printed joints into extrusion
- 4x M3x12mm SHCS
    - 2x through plate, into heatset in lower printed joint
    - 2x into extrusion end
- 2x M3x16mm SHCS
    - 2x through plate, into heatset in lower printed joint
- 2x M3x20mm SHCS
    - 2x through plate, through lower printed joint, into extrusion
- 8x M3 washer
    - 2x for the M3x12 SHCS into the ends of the extrusion
    - 6x for the M3 SHCS screws through bottom of the plates
    - No washers for the M3x6 BHCS screws that go into the carriages
- 2x M5x40mm SHCS
    - 2x through entire XY joint from top to bottom.
- 2x M5 washer
    - 2x between plate and nut
- 2x M5 nut
    - Secure the M5x40mm SHCS at the bottom of each plate. Tighten with a wrench + pliers
- 4x 5mm x 35mm shafts (These are different from the 40mm shafts used in the regular pins mod!)
